What it does
Visualizes Data:

Creates scatter plots showing the relationship between features (x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) for both binary and multi-class datasets.

Calculates Entropy:

Computes entropy to quantify the uncertainty in the labels (x_label and y_label) for both datasets.

Reports Entropy:

Prints the entropy values and the maximum possible entropy for the data.
